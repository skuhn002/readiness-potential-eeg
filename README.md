# readiness-potential-eeg
EEG Data analysis code used specifically for finding the readiness potential.

The Readiness Potential is an elctrical signature of free-will based movements which is supposed to present itself as a positive deflection in self-paced movement event-locked EEG data. The Analyze_Data.ipynb is used for plotting data collected from EEG recordings taken during self-paced movements, in the hopes of seeing a positive deflection in EEG data prior to movement onset (x=0 on average plots). We were unable to consistently replicate this signal over the 10-weeks I conducted this research, but the code for analyzing this data is still relevant for exploratory data analysis on similar event-locked EEG signatures.
